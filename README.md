# DevHub - Building Nex-Gen Developers
DevHub is a machine learning-based web application that will empower students in their core skills and help them become job ready. This platform will help students in getting mentorship through a machine learning model and professional community members, a well-structured roadmap for different domains, and an Internship to build real-world and complex projects. Our platform focuses on providing students with the latest learning opportunities and helping them build real-world projects, enhancing their technical and core skills. 

## Features
1. **Career Mentorship:** Personalized mentorship provided by our machine learning model, guiding students in their career choices and helping them excel in their chosen domains. 
2. **Roadmaps:** Professionally curated roadmaps for a wide range of technologies, providing students with clear learning paths and helping them achieve their career goals.
3. **Virtual Internships:** An online program that offers students valuable hands-on experience through automated pipelines, project assignments, and industry-recognized certificates. 
4. **NoCodePortfolio:** An automatic system that generates a responsive website for users on their information, allowing them to quickly create a portfolio without any coding knowledge.

## Project Impact
DevHub has made a positive impact by addressing the problem of inadequate technical education and limited career opportunities for students. Our solution provides mentorship, structured learning paths, and virtual internships, allowing students to gain industry-relevant skills and become job-ready professionals. The feedback from our users, with 85% positive feedback among 200 students, indicates the effectiveness and user satisfaction with our platform.

## Technical Architecture
DevHub's technical architecture supports scalability and future growth. Key components of our architecture include:

- Microservices Architecture: Utilizing a microservices approach allows independent scaling of backend services, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation based on demand.
- RESTful APIs: The use of RESTful APIs facilitates flexible handling of user requests and seamless communication between frontend and backend servers.
- Cloud-based Machine Learning: Our Career Mentorship module leverages Azure ML to efficiently scale machine learning resources based on demand, ensuring accurate and timely results for users.
- Database Management: Storing data in databases enables efficient retrieval and management of information for the roadmap module.
- User Interface: The frontend is built using modern web development technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface.
